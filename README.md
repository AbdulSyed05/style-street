## Deployment
The live deployed application can be found deployed on [Heroku](https://stylestreet-2f7b5324506f.herokuapp.com/).

#### Creating Repository on GitHub
- First make sure you are signed into [Github](https://github.com/) and go to the code institutes template, which can be found [here](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/gitpod-full-template).
- Then click on **use this template** and select **Create a new repository** from the drop-down. Enter the name for the repository and click **Create repository from template**.
- Once the repository was created, I clicked the green **gitpod** button to create a workspace in gitpod so that I could write the code for the site.

#### Creating an app on Heroku
- After creating the repository on GitHub, head over to [heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) and sign in.
- On the home page, click **New** and **Create new app** from the drop down.
- Give the app a name(this must be unique) and select a **region** I chose **Europe** as I am in Europe, Then click **Create app**.

#### Create a database On ElephantSQL
- Log into the [ElephantSQL](https://www.elephantsql.com/) website and click **Create new Instance**
- Enter a **Name** and keep the plan as **Tiny Turtle Free**, then **tags** field can be left blank, Select a region closest to you, I selected **EU-West-1(Ireland)** as I'm in Ireland. Then click **Review** and afterward click **create an instance**.
- On The Dashboard click on your database instance name.
- You will see the details for your database instance, in the URL section click on the copy icon to copy the database URL.
- Head over to gitpod and create a **Database URL** environment variable in your env.py file and set it equal to the copied URL.

#### Deploying to Heroku.
- Head back over to [heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) and click on your **app** and then go to the **Settings tab**
- On the **settings page** scroll down to the **config vars** section and enter the **DATABASE_URL** which you will set equal to the elephantSQL URL, create **Secret key** this can be anything,
**CLOUDINARY_URL** this will be set to your cloudinary url and finally **Port** which will be set to 8000.
- Then scroll to the top and go to the **deploy tab** and go down to the **Deployment method** section and select **Github** and then sign into your account.
- Below that in the **search for a repository to connect to** search box enter the name of your repository that you created on **GitHub** and click **connect**
- Once it has been connected scroll down to the **Manual Deploy** and click **Deploy branch** when it has deployed you will see a **view app** button below and this will bring you to your newly deployed app.
- Please note that when deploying manually you will have to deploy after each change you make to your repository.

### Local Deployment

This project can be cloned or forked in order to make a local copy on your own system.

For either method, you will need to install any applicable packages found within the *requirements.txt* file.
- `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`.

You will need to create a new file called `env.py` at the root-level,
and include the same environment variables listed above from the Heroku deployment steps.

Sample `env.py` file:

```python
import os

os.environ.setdefault("AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID", `HEROKU CONFIG VARS`)
os.environ.setdefault("AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY", `HEROKU CONFIG VARS`)
os.environ.setdefault("DATABASE_URL", `HEROKU CONFIG VARS`)
os.environ.setdefault("EMAIL_HOST_PASS", `HEROKU CONFIG VARS`)
os.environ.setdefault("EMAIL_HOST_USER", `HEROKU CONFIG VARS`)
os.environ.setdefault("SECRET_KEY", `HEROKU CONFIG VARS`)
os.environ.setdefault("STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY", `HEROKU CONFIG VARS`)
os.environ.setdefault("STRIPE_SECRET_KEY", `HEROKU CONFIG VARS`)
os.environ.setdefault("STRIPE_WH_SECRET", `HEROKU CONFIG VARS`)

# local environment only (do not include these in production/deployment!)
os.environ.setdefault("DEBUG", "True")
```

Once the project is cloned or forked, in order to run it locally, you'll need to follow these steps:
- Start the Django app: `python3 manage.py runserver`
- Stop the app once it's loaded: `CTRL+C` or `⌘+C` (Mac)
- Make any necessary migrations: `python3 manage.py makemigrations`
- Migrate the data to the database: `python3 manage.py migrate`
- Create a superuser: `python3 manage.py createsuperuser`
- Load fixtures (if applicable): `python3 manage.py loaddata file-name.json` (repeat for each file)
- Everything should be ready now, so run the Django app again: `python3 manage.py runserver`
